WordPress Video SEO plugin allows you to generate a sitemap for your videos. It helps search engine index your videos for better ranking.

== Description ==

Video sitemap is a way to help search engine discover your videos and index them accordingly. It also allows you to link one video to a specific post/page

= WP Video SEO Features =

* Generate a sitemap for your YouTube videos
* Reduce the time taken by the search engine to index your videos
* Allow search engine to display a thumbnail of the video along with the title and description of the post/page

= WP Video SEO Plugin Usage =

*Video Sitemap Generation*

The plugin is fairly simple to use. Once you have installed the plugin go to the settings menu of the plugin from your WP Dashboard (Settings->WP Video SEO). Click on the "Generate Video Sitemap" button which will create a video sitemap in the root directory of your site. Check to make sure that the file "sitemap-video.xml" has been created.

If you make any changes to your existing posts/pages the sitemap will be updated automatically. So you just need to generate it once. The full URL to your video sitemap usually looks like the following:

[www.example.com/sitemap-video.xml]

If you are using Google Webmaster Tools you can submit the "sitemap-video.xml" file as a sitemap which will allow you to monitor the index status of your videos.
